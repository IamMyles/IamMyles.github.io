When I was in high school, I took a programming class at the nearby community college and was immediately hooked. I knew what I wanted to do with my life, program. What I wanted to program didn't really seem to matter to me, just so long as I could program. Of course I would have enjoyed video game development, but as it's quite a saturated field, I figured I'd go with one that is far more in demand. And in comes software development.

With a massive amount of jobs out there, it seemed like a no brainer to become a software developer. Good pay, I'd enjoy doing it, and I could even work from home if I needed to. So for me, it seems like a great job, and I think I'll really enjoy doing it.
